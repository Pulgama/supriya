`Supriya`_ is a `Python`_ interface to `SuperCollider`_.

Supriya lets you:

-   boot and communicate with `SuperCollider`_'s ``scsynth`` synthesis server
-   construct and compile ``SynthDef`` unit generator graphs in native Python code
-   build and control graphs of synthesizers and synthesizer groups
-   object-model ``scysnth`` OSC communications explicitly via ``Request`` and
    ``Response`` classes
-   compile non-realtime synthesis scores via Supriya's
    ``nonrealtimetools.Session`` class

..  note:: This project is still under **heavy** development, is **not** yet
           stable, and is **not** yet intended for deployment in the field.
