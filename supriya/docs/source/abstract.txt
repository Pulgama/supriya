Supriya is a Python interface to SuperCollider.

Supriya lets you:

-   boot and communicate with SuperCollider's `scsynth` synthesis server
-   construct and compile `SynthDef` unit generator graphs in native Python code
-   build and control graphs of synthesizers and synthesizer groups
-   object-model `scysnth` OSC communications explicitly via `Request` and
    `Response` classes
-   compile non-realtime synthesis scores

..  note:: This project is still under **heavy** development, is **not** yet
           stable, and is **not** yet intended for deployment in the field.
