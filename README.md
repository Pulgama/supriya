A Python interface to SuperCollider (very much in progress).

Current operative functionality:

- starting the SuperCollider server
- OSC communication to and from the server
- compiling synthesizer definitions identically to how SC would

Currently under development:

- Server, Node, Group, and Synth
- StatusWatcher
- OscCallback
- Envelope
