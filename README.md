A Python interface to SuperCollider (very much in progress).

Current operative functionality:

    - starting the SuperCollider server
    - basic OSC communication to and from the server
    - compiling synthesizer definitions identically to how SC would

Currently under development:

    - Server, Node, Group, Synth and NodeWatcher
